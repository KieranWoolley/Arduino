% The temp_monitor function is used to create a live graph of temperature
% readings taken every second over a 10 minute time period. The function
% also uses green, red, and yellow to indicate temperature readings. If the
% temperature is between 18 and 24 degrees then the green LED will turn on.
% If the temperature is above 24 degrees than the red LED will flash at
% 0.25 second intervals. If the the temperature is below 18 degrees than
% the yellow LED will flash at 0.5 second intervals.
